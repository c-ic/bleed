## Notice
- This project is currently under works and will most likely not be finished for quite some time.
- If you would like to contribute, open a [pull request](https://github.com/c-ic/bleed/pulls) and I'll get to it ASAP.

## Why?
For fun, there is zero inspiration behind this project.
On top of this, many people will base their projects off existing shitty bases, so I'm creating this to replace those shit bases.
